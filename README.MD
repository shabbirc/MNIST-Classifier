Problem Statement
Here, we will build a complete neural network using Numpy. You will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc.

We will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.

The assignment is divided into the following sections:

    Data preparation
    Feedforward
    Loss computation
    Backpropagation
    Parameter updates
    Model training and predictions
